This is version 3 (3.9) of the editor.

Version 2 corresponds to version 3 without the enhancements in 3.
There is no reason to use 2 unless you have a pdp-11 that does not have
overlay software, since 3 contains all the bug fixes and some new features.

The include file local/uparm.h should be installed, as ex_tune.h needs it.
The contents of this include file can be modified if you wish to place
the editor in a nonstandard location.

Conditional compilation flags:
	-DTRACE		for debugging
	-DVFORK		for UCB Vax/Unix with the vfork system call.
	-DCHDIR		compile in undocumented chdir (cd) command
	-DLISP		compile in lisp hacks
	-DUCVISUAL	compile in code to handle \ escapes for visual on
			upper case only terminals.  gross.
